                <div class="pa">
                    <span class="drop_cap">T</span>here are many children today who are vulnerable and have been exposed to different kinds of abuse all over the world. Most especially in Africa where many governments don’t show any caring for the children growing up. </div><br>
                    <div class="pa">Many girls, boys, and teenagers have been exposed to sexual harassment and many are victims of rape and different kinds of abuse. We have heard many stories of a father’s having sex with their daughter(s), and uncles raping girls put under their care. </div> <br>
                    <div class="pa">All types of abuse and neglect leave lasting scars. Some of these scars might be physical, but emotional scarring might have long-lasting effects throughout life, damaging a child’s sense of self, future relationships, and ability to function at home, work, and school. Some of these scars still affect them even when they get married. Only through prayers, the word of God, and multiple Biblical counseling can the scars in the heart of abused and neglected children be cured <br>
                        <div class="pa">Our mission is to educate the neglected children and be responsible for their well-being. Some of these neglected ones do not have the capacity to study in high school or the university, but we can educate them to obtain an apprenticeship. Our organization will equip them with relevant types of machinery they will need to set up their business in the future. As we all know apprenticeship is a system for training a new generation of practitioners of a trade or profession with on-the-job training and often some accompanying study. At the end of their study, we would give them a license/certificate to practice in a regulated occupation or to own their own company. <br>
                            <div class="pa">All these things depend on their vision and their dream. Learning apprenticeship is a way of empowering the less privileged and these people can become great entrepreneurs in the future, by doing we are building and positively empowering our generation. <br>
                                <div class="pa">Our mission is to support and gather resources to prevent child abuse and neglected ones in our communities. <br>

               <div class="pa">Young people live in a society in which creating sustainable career opportunities is complex. Guidance is crucial to support motivated, smart career-choices and prevent early leaving from education and training for a number of reasons <b> : </b> </div><br>
                <div class="pa"><b> •</b>	Students or their families may give priority to general education over RATOLF, while RATOLF pathways might very well be the best fit for a student’s preferences, attitudes, and , learning style, –allowing students to better explore their potential and take better advantage of career opportunities. Guidance avoids the usual biases about learning pathways, putting the focus on personal skills and interests.</div> <br>
                    <div class="pa"><b> •</b>	The vocational nature and often high level of specialisation in RATOLF mean that there are many choices on offer within this learning track. Guidance can help in navigating through the many options of RATOLF and the often complex application procedures. </div><br>
                        <div class="pa"><b> •</b>	Appropriate guidance helps young people understand their learning needs and career preferences based on their strengths and characteristics rather than stigmatising them as “bad students” and generating feelings of inadequacy. It can lead young people to have an active, engaged attitude to education and learning in general. </div><br>
                            <div class="pa"><b> •</b>	Receiving adequate information about the RATOLF programme in which a young person is enrolled or for the occupation he/she will be studying can contribute to a successful learning path. Such information may be about the working conditions, the technical complexity of the programme and occupation, or the jobs a programme can lead to.</div> <br>
                                <div class="pa"><b> •</b>	Support during studies can also be key to a successful learning path. Such support may involve help with the choice of a specialization, the transition to the workplace (e.g. for work-based learning), or networking into the occupational community, among other aspects. </div> <br><br>

                Vulnerable groups <br>
                <div class="pa">RATOLF schools can help foster smart career choices and prevent early school leaving by providing career education and guidance at an early stage and promoting the development of career management skills. Career education can help identify and engage young people, especially the ones at risk of early leaving. It may be particularly useful to prepare transitions and it can help learners who are struggling with the programme they have just joined to continue successfully on their pathway or to find a new one. <br>
                Career guidance is also suitable to help reengage early leavers from education and training. Career guidance services, employment services or social services are well placed to provide career guidance to low-qualified young people. </div><br>

                <div class="pa">Career guidance refers to a range of activities that aim to support individuals manage their careers and make educational, training and occupational choices match their personal characteristics (e.g. strengths, learning style, etc.). It includes: <br>
                
                    Career information and advice about education, training, and work opportunities. <br>
                    Career counselling delivered by practitioners with psychological training. <br>
                    Other activities to help learners develop career management skills, such as:  <br>
                        Assessing (e.g., through psychological tests or skills portfolios); <br>
                        Sampling: providing work simulations or learning tasters to allow young people to experiment with career choices. <br>
                       <b style="color: red;"> Teaching.</b> RATOLF schools may provide career education as part of the curriculum (e.g., a course on self-efficacy, CV, and presentation letters elaboration, etc.). It can be delivered either as a separate subject, as part of another subject, or as a cross-curricular

                Across the different activities, there are important considerations to bear in mind in order to effectively use career guidance to tackle early leaving.

                <span class="drop_cap">W</span>hat Is Community Empowerment according to (World Health Organisation, WHO) <br>
                Community empowerment refers to the process of enabling communities to increase control over their lives. “Communities” are groups of people that may or may not be spatially connected, but who share common interests, concerns, or identities. These communities could be local, national, or international, with specific or broad interests. ‘Empowerment’ refers to the process by which people gain control over the factors and decisions that shape their lives. It is the process by which they increase their assets and attributes and build capacities to gain access, partners, networks, and/or a voice, to gain control. “Enabling” implies that people cannot “be empowered” by others; they can only empower themselves by acquiring more of power’s different forms (Laverack, 2008). It assumes that people are their own assets, and the role of the external agent is to catalyse, facilitate or “accompany” the community in acquiring power. </div><br>
                <div class="pa">Community empowerment, therefore, is more than the involvement, participation, or engagement of communities. It implies community ownership and action that explicitly aims at social and political change. Community empowerment is a process of re-negotiating power in order to gain more control. It recognizes that if some people are going to be empowered, then others will be sharing their existing power and giving some of it up (Baum, 2008). Power is a central concept in community empowerment and health promotion invariably operates within the arena of a power struggle.</div> <br>
                    <div class="pa">Community empowerment necessarily addresses the social, cultural, political, and economic determinants that underpin health, and seeks to build partnerships with other sectors in finding solutions.</div>
