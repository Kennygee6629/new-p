          <h2 class="hed" style="color: #b2502d;">Story Behind River and Tree of Life Foundation (RATOLF)</h2>
          <div class="pa" style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="drop_cap">I</span> started this foundation River and Tree of Life Foundation - RATOLF because of the Vow I made with God. My growing up is very hard and painful, I did not enjoy most of my teenage life. I went through pain and agony as I was growing up, I was helpless, abused, neglected, and experienced homelessness many times. I did not have a brother, sister, or uncle to help me. I put all my trust only in God. I prayed to God that if He could help me and make me great in life, I will help the poor. I went through fire in life in the form of trials, and I nearly gave up. </div> <br>
            <div class="pa">
              <span class="drop_cap">I</span> cried to God one day and I told God that this pain was too much for me. I told God that He is the only one that I have, and asked Him, “Why do You hate me so much and allow me to go through this pain? WHY ME?” Then God answered, “WHY NOT YOU? Because you can’t give what you don’t have.” God said that He was training me so that you could understand what pain all is about. He said that in the future when I see children or people in pain I would be there for them and help them out. </div> <br>
              <div class="pa">
                I was born in a very poor family in Epe Lagos State Nigeria and my father had married 3 wives, my mother being the second wife. In Nigeria, when you are born into a polygamous family that will be the beginning of your warfare.
    My father was a professional fisherman just like Apostle Peter in the Bible. My father was illiterate as he did not go to school, and fishing was his trade all his life.</div> <br>
    <div class="pa">
      My father married my mother as a second wife because of what Yoruba call (Abiku). Abiku refers to the spirits of children who die before reaching puberty; a child who dies before twelve years of age is called an Abiku. According to Yoruba tradition, abiku is a spirit of a child who dies young, the belief is that the spirit returns to the same mother multiple times to be reborn multiple times. It is the belief that the spirit does not ever plan to "stay put in life" so it is indifferent to the plight of its mother and her grief. </div><br>
      <div class="pa">
        According to the wisdom of man in the life of my father, coupled with the counsel of men, he was advised to take a second wife. Peradventure, if he married the second wife the spirit might leave him alone, but unfortunately, it was not so. Immediately my mother became pregnant the spirit jumped into her life as well and she lost he first and second child. I remain the firstborn of my mother today but at the beginning of her marital life, it was not so.</div> <br>
        <div class="pa">
          According to the frame of God, He laid into the heart of my maternal grandfather to pick me up while I was still being breastfed. I was one year old when I started staying with my grandparents and they promised to take good care of me. Thus, I lived with my grandparent until their death. Little did I know that these would be the best years of my childhood.</div>

             3 Tragedy that happened to me within 3 years</h1>

             <div class="pa">
              <span class="drop_cap">M</span>y grandfather died in 1978, my grandmother died a year later, and my father died in early 1981, 3 years after my grandfather died. These 3 tragedies caused me a lot of pain in life as I was growing up. My father died while I was in my first year of secondary school. I became helpless and empty when my father died because there was no one to play the role of a father figure in my life. I made a lot of mistakes as I was growing up because there was no one to counsel me. I started staying with my uncle after the death of my grandfather. </div> <br>

              <div class="pa">My uncle had four children then and education was so expensive at that particular time. The military had taken over the government in Nigeria and had swiftly put a stop to free education. The Ogun State government changed the education policy whereby every secondary student must pay school fees. My uncle was a teacher, as we all know the government doesn’t pay good salaries to teachers, and he had to pay the school fees of his four children, and he could not afford to pay my tuition fees. My mother also could not pay for my tuition fees because she had no job or business. I was left to carry my cross at the age of 13 years.</div> <br>

                <div class="pa">There was no one to help me and as a result I had to do odd jobs here and there after school hours. At the close of school each day at 2 pm I would resume at the sawmill for odd jobs. This was what I did throughout my secondary school to pay for my school fees, and buy my school uniforms, shoes, clothing, and other necessities because there was no one to help. </div><br>

                  <div class="pa">As a result of the suffering, I went through when I was growing up, when I see someone suffering around me, I always give the little that I have to help all the ones I can because I don’t like seeing people suffering in my surroundings. That is why I started this foundation with my wife Mwaka Peter over 12 years ago using our income to help people in South Africa and Nigeria.</div>

          <span class="drop_cap">M</span>e are fundraising focusing on Save Nigerian Abandoned and Molested Children initiative
of the <span style="color:red;"> River and Tree of Life Foundation</span> (RATOLF). RATOLF is an NGO registered in
Nigeria, to launch an emergency clarion rescue call to alert the world on the neglect of the
molested and abandoned children of Nigeria. This is much more alarming in the
ghetto/rural based areas of the country. </div> <br>
        <div class="pa">Initially, the founders of RATOLF have been the sole sponsors of most of the NGO’s
community engagement activities for the past 12 years. RATOLF has been paying the
school fees of several children in Nigeria, helping and feeding the homeless in South
        <div class="pa"> Africa and Nigeria, and supporting small churches in Nigeria by providing musical
equipment. </div> <br>
        <div class="pa">Our<span style="color:red;"> focus is mainly on Nigerian abandoned and molested children</span>.</div> <br>

        <div class="pa">The need for support has grown beyond has grown beyond our means, and we are asking
for your help.</div> <br>
        <div class="pa"><span style="color:skyblue;">Do you know that over 17,000,000 children are abandoned in Nigeria, some of these
children are molested?</span> </div><br>
RATOLF’s project will initially train 10 Local leaders to facilitate agency-based
empowerment workshops and support 300 vulnerable girls and boys with tuition fees,
school supplies, food, and counselling.</div> <br>
        <div class="pa">However, the need for support has grown beyond the capacity of an individual; if at all, we
want to achieve the objective of the initiative. Therefore, we are calling for your support
and donations to help others.</div> <br>
        <div class="pa">We are raising<span style="color:red;"> $50,000 for SAVE ABANDONED AND MOLESTED CHILDREN IN
